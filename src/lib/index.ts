/*
TODO #1:
  + move example to lib (web-examples directory)
  -/+ finalize examples
    + add SCSS
    + implement advanced example HTML/CSS
    + enter sends the message
    + text and hex mode
    + history show sent and received frames
    - detect own transmitted frame caught by the microphone on the same machine
    - finalize advanced chat example
    - remove hex-bytes example
  + rename methods at Data Link class: setTxBytes, getRxBytes
  + move configs outside package.json: jest, prettier
  + source map in prod? NO!!
  + PhysicalLayer class should have rxTimeTick and txTimeTick methods, DataLinkLayer class should
    have mandatory parameters in txTimeTick rxTimeTick that is passed to PhysicalLayer and AudioMonoIo
  + comment console logs!!
  - PREPARE THE RELEASE: 0.1.0

TODO #2:
  - implement ApplicationLayer/TransportLayer, key ideas:
    - files on chat send by starting the byte stream by ASCII 0x1C File Separator byte
      STREAM DETAILS: 0x1C {filename bytes in UTF-8} 0x00 {bytes of the file}
  - refactor imports to absolute paths
  - performance checker (store previous getFrequencyData array and compare with current) + example
  - find alternative for coveralls
  - schedule tx frame frequencies at web audio api rather than setInternal from the clients side
    UPDATE: Maybe not implement it? :) In general all works fine up to ~15 raw bytes per second
  - PREPARE THE RELEASE: 0.2.0

TODO #3:
  - PhysicalLayer should store history based on time tick values (getHistory, setHistory methods?)
    UPDATE: abstract class that handles history and virtual methods to be implemented in real classes (?)
    UPDATE: getFrequencyDomainData could return null (or []) when history record will end
  - physical layer constructor should get configs rather than modes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    in current implementation it is not possible use custom config - client needs to rely on hardcoded modes
    UPDATE: ...or add dedicated method to set custom config for those that want to experiment
  - experiment with a bit higher safeMarginFactor to produce rawByteRates like: 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20/24?, 24/32?
  - check constraints https://github.com/quiet/quiet-js/blob/master/quiet.js#L565
