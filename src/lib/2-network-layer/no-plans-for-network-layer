Currently I'm not planning to implement network layer but sonic router would be nice! ;)

UPDATE 2019.10.05:

A real router would be too complex as Network Layer would need to be
active (receive and resend data). Some ideas to make it simpler:

  - quite feasible would be to create one local network where every device hears all devices (no router needed)
  - destination 'IP' addresses stored in 4 bits will give 16 unique values
  - source 'IP' addresses stored in 4 bits will give 16 unique values
  - it would require one additional byte in Data Link Layer frame
