Currently I'm not planning to implement network layer but sonic router would be nice! ;)

Some ideas
  - quite feasible would be to create one local network where every device hears all devices (no router needed)
  - 'IP' addresses from  0 to 254 (255 devices) and one 255 for broadcast
  - it would require one additional byte in Data Link Layer frame so a bit waste of bandwidth...
  - router to complex as Network Layer would need to be active (receive and resend data)
